// Understanding Errors and Warnings...
console.log('Understanding Errors');

// Trying to throw an error:
const a = 'Hello';
const b = 'World';
// This will probably throw an error:
console.log(c);
// First, this is the error:
// Uncaught ReferenceError: c is not defined.
// The type of the error is "ReferenceError";
// Also, the browsers will tell you the file which the error occur and the line (with the character);
