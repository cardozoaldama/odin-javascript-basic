// The select tag with its options:
// Creating two constants.
// Using this "document.querySelector()" to acquired our tags.

// We are going to add an Event Listener:
// And the "setWeather" is not created yet.
// Also, the "select" is our select over there and will trigger an event if something is "changed":
select.addEventListener('change', setWeather);
// The function "setWeather()"
function setWeather()

    // The assignment value is "select.value".
    // "select.value" is... Our select over there, but precisely its actual value.

    // In these cases, we are using the === operator.
    // para.textContent means: Put a string inside of this variable (para)
