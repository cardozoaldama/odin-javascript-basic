/* We are going to learn about Arrays... */
// Code begins:
console.log('Welcome to the world of Arrays!');

// An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value:
const gtaCars = ['Banshee', 'ZR-350', 'Sultan'];
// This array is better than:
/**
 * let car1 = 'Banshee';
 * let car2 = 'ZR-350';
 * let car3 = 'Sultan';
