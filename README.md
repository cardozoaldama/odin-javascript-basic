# JavaScript Foundations

In this repository I will learn about the basics of JavaScript and some other kind of stuff such as DOM and anything else from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

The basic JavaScript is in this module: [Basic JavaScript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#javascript-basics).

Then I will create another repository for more advance stuff. It's free!

## New changes soon about theory

About what theory? Simple, it is about Problem Solving and Understanding Errors.

The Problem Solving is important when you want to develop something, it is an important skill. 

## What is the next step?

The next step is practicing about DOM and some basic events.
