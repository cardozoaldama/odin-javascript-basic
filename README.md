# JavaScript Foundations

In this repository I will learn about the basics of JavaScript and some other kind of stuff such as DOM and anything else from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

The basic JavaScript is in this module: [Basic JavaScript](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#javascript-basics).

Then I will create another repository for more advance stuff. It's free!

## New changes soon about theory

About what theory? Simple, it is about Problem Solving and Understanding Errors.
