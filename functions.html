        2. Write a function called multiply that takes 2 numbers and returns their product.
        3. Write a function called capitalize that takes a string and returns that string with only the first letter capitalized. Make sure that it can take strings that are lowercase, UPPERCASE or BoTh.
        4. Write a function called lastLetter that takes a string and returns the very last letter of that string:
